            Thank you for your participation in this experiment. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of “Ghost Trails” on security decision. In this experiment, you were told to make security decisions whether to save credit card info, run flash on browser or consent social media information, but before that, you are presented with the pros/cons of a particular decision. We are recording how ghost-trails could influence the decision. We are not trying to hint the user toward a decision, but we want them to make an informed decision without knowing what the consequence might be.
        <br>
        Your participation is not only greatly appreciated by the researchers involved, but the data collected could possibly enhance the security world and prevent leaks, hacks from happening in this technological world.
        <br>
